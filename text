This is a one-year HEP/ASCR DOE pilot project to evaluate and broaden the range of
computational techniques and algorithms utilized in addressing  HEP tracking challenges. 
Specifically the project  will provide a
framework to develop and evaluate new algorithms for track finding and
classification, that will be demonstrated by applying advanced pattern recognition
techniques to track candidate formation. For example, an optimized track formation algorithm that 
scales linearly with LHC luminosity, rather than quadratically or worse, may lead by itself to an order of
magnitude improvement in the track processing throughput without affecting the
track identification performance, hence maintaining the physics performance intact in the LHC upgrades.
